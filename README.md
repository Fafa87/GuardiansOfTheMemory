# GuardiansOfTheMemory

Guardians of the memory stand between you and very dark and grim times, where life is lost, dispair spreads like a disease and basically you have to redo all unsaved work.


## Why?

- protection against the danger when working with huge data / objects
- when out of memory and paging is on everything freezes and commonly reset is necessary
- it is general solution to any source of memory usage overload
- more musing on it [link]

## What?

- `draox.py` - the first protector: crude, not sophisticated but does the work

## Tests?

You can check if it stops our sample offenders, just run `draox.py` and then run one of them.

## Success stories?

- "I've loaded big tiff into ImageJ, then I wanted to load the results of its processing. It takes a while so I stopped tracking that.
After a few minutes I wanted to go back to it but could not find ImageJ anywhere. That's when I noticed Draox smile at me.
Thanks for saving me!" - Richard Bubblegum
